1. create free AI token in NVIDIA website

2. clone this repository 
   https://github.com/zhangrr/claude-nvidia-proxy

3. I did some changes to fix some problems 
   check 'main.go' file 

   also I wanted to run it as docker and not : ' go run .'
   so you will also see Dockerfile, dockerbuild and dockerrun

4. put these files inside the clone repository
