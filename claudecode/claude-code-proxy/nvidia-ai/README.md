1. create free AI token in NVIDIA website

2. clone this repository 

   https://github.com/zhangrr/claude-nvidia-proxy

3. I did some changes to fix some problems

   check 'main.go' file 

   also I wanted to run it as docker and not : ' go run .'

   so you will also see Dockerfile, dockerbuild and dockerrun

4. put these files inside the clone repository

5. make sure you ran the docker run of proxy in the background...

    then run these commands 

6.  after you put your token inside run-claude and choose AI model

    you can run :

   ./run-claude
